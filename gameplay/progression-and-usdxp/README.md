# Progression and $XP

## Experience Points ($XP)

Opening a new magick bag has a chance to reward $XP, which can be used to change things through crafting, leveling up, etc.

### Getting $XP

Ways to generate $XP premium currency are:



* In-game rewards
* Complete surveys like user testing maybe; might require real identification
* Receive gift / Airdrop
* Ads
* Buy it
* ??

### Crafting with $XP

#### Open Bag

Open a Magick Bag NFT and receive its contents which may include some $XP

#### Item Creation

Deconstruct items to get crafting components which may include $XP

Mix items with $XP to create other items.

#### Character Creation

Mix items with $XP to craft a character (could be simulated in an app so the player thinks they are getting free $XP that is immediately applied).

#### Land Creation

Mix plants and dirt together with $XP to create bits of land named Arda.

## Selling Stuff

Combine stuff using $XP into a magic bag that has its contents viewable to the buyer, to sell it in a marketplace.&#x20;

Selling generates more $XP for the seller as the buyer pays a fee to cover this.

Selling can also generate $MGK
