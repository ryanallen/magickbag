Ideas include:

* tools for appraising Crafted items, characters and land

## **LOTR Lore**

**Arda** ([Q](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya): "Realm") was the [Quenya](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya) name for the world as a whole. Arda was created within [Eä](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/E%C3%A4) by [Eru Ilúvatar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Il%C3%BAvatar). It was then shaped by the [Valar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar), with continental masses such as [Middle-earth](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth) and [Aman](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aman), and oceans, like [Belegaer](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Belegaer).

Arda was the home of [Elves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elves), [Men](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Men), [Dwarves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dwarves) and other [races](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Portal:Characters) as well as the [kelvar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kelvar) and [olvar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Olvar). Some of the [Ainur](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ainur) govern the world under [Eru](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Il%C3%BAvatar)'s mandate.

Arda was first brought into existence with the [Music of the Ainur](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Music\_of\_the\_Ainur), for the purpose of creating a home for the [Children of Ilúvatar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Children\_of\_Il%C3%BAvatar). Ilúvatar appointed the [Valar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar) as its masters, and it was built mainly by [Manwë](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Manw%C3%AB), [Aulë](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aul%C3%AB) and [Ulmo](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ulmo).

But even before the coming of some [Ainur](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Ainur) there were other beings inhabiting Arda, perhaps without the Ainur's involvement or knowledge.[\[note 1\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda#cite\_note-0) One of them was [Iarwain Ben-adar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar)[\[1\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda#cite\_note-1) (Tom Bombadil as a guide?? [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar)) and other mysterious [nameless things](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Nameless\_things) that eventually withdrew in caves under mountains.[\[2\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda#cite\_note-2)[\[3\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda#cite\_note-3)

Add a characters section. Character has had many names:



He also went by other names:

* To the [Elves](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elves) and [Dúnedain](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/D%C3%BAnedain), he was known with the [Sindarin](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindarin) name [_**Iar**_](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iaur)[_**wain**_](http://tolkiengateway.net/w/index.php?title=Gwain\&action=edit\&redlink=1) _****_ [_**Ben-adar**_](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Penadar), which translates to "Oldest and Fatherless".[\[4\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-CoE-3) _Iarwain_ literally means "Old-young"[\[10\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-9)
* To [Men](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Men) of the [Vales of Anduin](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vales\_of\_Anduin) and [Rohan](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Rohan), he was known with the [Rohirric](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Rohirric) name _**Orald**_.[\[4\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-CoE-3) This is an [Old English](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Old\_English) word meaning "very ancient.[\[11\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-nomen-10)
* The Dwarves knew him as _**Forn**_. This too is a reference to his age: it is [Old Norse](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/North\_Germanic\_languages) for "(belonging to) ancient (days)".[\[11\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-nomen-10)[\[note 1\]](http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Iarwain\_Ben-adar#cite\_note-11)
